# Quix Clickstream Analysis Template

Welcome to the Quix Clickstream Analysis Template! This repository provides a template for leveraging the power of the Quix platform to perform real-time clickstream analysis. With this template, you can see how to detect and trigger events dynamically based on real-time analysis of click behavior.

## Features

- **Real-time analysis:** The template empowers you to analyze user clickstreams in real time, allowing you to gain immediate insights into how users interact with your website or application.

- **Quix platform integration:** This template is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Quix platform. Quix provides a user-friendly environment for managing and analyzing data, making it an ideal choice for real-time clickstream analysis.

- **Custom built front end:** We have built a front end in the form of a web store. This simple shop allows the user to select their age and gender and click through to products in several different categories.

- **Real-time dashboard:** We have built a real-time dashboard using Streamlit and connected it to Quix using Redis.
